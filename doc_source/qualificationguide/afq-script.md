# FreeRTOS Qualification Check Script<a name="afq-script"></a>

After you have ported FreeRTOS, tested your ports, and gathered the other qualification items, run a qualification check script before you submit\.

For instructions on running the script, see the script's README file on [GitHub](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos/tree/master/tools/checks/afqp/afqp_check)\.

**Note**  
The script might return warnings for libraries that you did not port\. You can ignore these warnings\.
